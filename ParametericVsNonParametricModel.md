# Parametric vs Non-Parametric models

# Parametric models come with some assumptions.
  * Logistic Regression
  * Linear Discriminant Analysis
  * Perceptron
  * Naive Bayes
  * Simple Neural Networks

For instance:
1. Linearity regression comes with assumptions:  
   Linear Relationship, Normality, No or Little Multicollinearity ,No Autocorrelation in errors, Homoscedasticity.
2. Logistic regression does not make many of the key assumptions of Linearity regression but based on ordinary least squares algorithms.
   Independent,  No Multicollinearity, Outliers, homoscedasticity.
   
# Nonparametric models come with no assumptions.   
 * Decision Trees like CART and C4.5
 * Neural networks 
 * k-Nearest Neighbors
 * Support Vector Machines

Neural networks are non-parametric. 
They do not assume a particular family of distributions and try to select the best fit ones, they make judgments without assuming a distribution.
