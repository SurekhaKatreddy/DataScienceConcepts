# Outliers
Outliers are the extreme values in the given data. 

# Statistic definition
statistically speaking outliers are at the extreme ends 
1. below 1.5 time IQR i.e outlier < Q1 - 1.5(IQR)
2. Above 1.5 time IQR i.e outlier > Q1 + 1.5(IQR)

# Let's understand Quartlies and IQR(Inter Quartile range)
The IQR describes the middle 50% of values when ordered from lowest to highest. To find the interquartile range (IQR), 
1. find the median (middle value) of the lower and upper half of the data. These values are quartile 1 (Q1) and quartile 3 (Q3). 
2. The IQR is the difference between Q3 and Q1.

Percentage of values in the IQR:
50% of the values lie in the inter-quartile range(IQR)

In normal distribution, mean = median = mode of the distribution.
μ (mu) is the mean of the distribution, and σ (sigma) is its standard deviation

# 68–95–99.7 rule, also known as the empirical rule
68.27% values falls under 1 standard deviation of the mean.
95% of the values fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean.
99.7% of the values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.
