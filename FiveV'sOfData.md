Velocity, volume, value, variety and veracity are the five main characteristics of big data. 
Knowing the 5 V's allows data scientists to derive more value from their data while also allowing the scientists' organization to become more 
customer-centric.

# Velocity and Volume resulted in MPP(Massively parallel programming) distributed architectures.
To handle large volumes of data, Distributed Architecture came into picture.
The rapidly emanating data coming in variety and volumes required the data to be processed at much faster rate than the traditional data processing
in the transactional system. This resulted in the evolution of distributed data processing.

# Variety
As data is generated in various forms such as structured, semi-strcutured and unstructured, in addition to the traditional structures such as
Relational Database systems, Schemaless Databases such as Lake, Blob and object Stores. 
For instance, As a NoSQL database, MongoDB is considered schemaless because it does not require a rigid, pre-defined schema like a relational database.

# Value
Data valuation helps companies see how much their data is worth. Knowing how much the data is worth can help to determine how to collect, store, protect and distribute it. Data adds value to business decisions by providing useful information. This information is the result of an effective data analytics strategy. 
Business Analytics is a process of gathering, analysing and drawing valuable conclusions from the vast amount of data available. Today, businesses, irrespective of their size, are using analytics tools to determine how data can be leveraged to solve problems and increase efficiency and revenue.
